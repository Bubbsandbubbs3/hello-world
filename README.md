# hello-world
=============

My name is- whoa, wait up. I'm not telling you my actual name! Well, I might. You'll probably figure it out anyways. But for now, call me Bubbs.

I like to program in HTML/Javascript, and C#. I may or may not be linked with Agentfly42 on SoundCloud. I also like melons. And biscuits. And bread.

Oh yeah, and I take ChangeTip, so if you want to give me money you can. :3

Thank you for your time. *dies*
